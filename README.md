## 1. Programmable World Model
**Authors:** Zheng-Hui Huang, Guixu Lin, Jiacheng Lin, Yi-Chuan Huang, Ruihan Yu, Muyao Niu, Siqi Yang, Yu-Lun Liu, Yung-Yu Chuang, Kaipeng Zhang, Zhixiang Wang

**Summary:** Recent video world models generate increasingly realistic and interactive visual experiences, yet lack reliable mechanisms for maintaining persistent world state and enforcing programmable rules over extended interactions. We introduce Programmable World Model, a framework that decouples world-state evolution from visual observation generation. An agent translates natural-language instructions into executable programs that specify entity states and state-transition rules, enabling direct control over individual entities and their interactions. A lightweight engine executes these programs to update and maintain an explicit, persistent global world state, including off-screen entities and non-visual attributes. To connect world state with visual generation, we introduce state-augmented 3D oriented bounding boxes (OBBs) as an intermediate representation. This representation, together with the target camera trajectory, is deterministically compiled into pixel-aligned spatiotemporal conditioning signals for a pretrained video model serving as the generative renderer. This design allows users to create playable games with predefined mechanics, direct control over individual entities, and persistent world state throughout gameplay. We further introduce CombatStateBench, a benchmark for evaluating programmable world models. On CombatStateBench, our method achieves 94% Count Accuracy and 98% State Accuracy, substantially outperforming existing interactive video world models while supporting coherent long-horizon generation. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of separating explicit state evolution from generative rendering for building persistent, programmable worlds.

## 2. Likelihood-free inference with nuisance parameters through normalizing flows
**Authors:** Phil Assheton

**Summary:** We present a simple decomposition of a neural-network-based normalizing flow that naturally uncovers a pivotal statistic (or something close) in the presence of nuisance parameters, based only on a sample generator from the distribution of interest. We show that the statistic is near-pivotal in the sense of minimum average KL-divergence of its $p$-values versus uniform and we argue that it can be expected to have good power when the dimension of the statistic equals the dimension of the parameter. It is able to incorporate prior knowledge about group invariances such as translation and scale. It can discover the one-sample $t$-test almost exactly, outperforms the Welch test in terms of worst-case size over a constrained variance-ratio range and achieves good calibration on partial biserial correlations, while showing higher power (and being much faster) on small-to-moderate samples than profile likelihood-ratio techniques.

## 3. Guiding Image-to-3D Generation with Test-Time Partial Observations
**Authors:** Jerred Chen, Simon Weber, Ronald Clark

**Summary:** Image-to-3D models can generate visually compelling 3D assets from a single RGB image, but their geometry is often only loosely constrained by the available observations, limiting their use in applications that require geometric fidelity. In many real-world settings, however, partial geometric observations of the object may be available at test time. We introduce a training-free framework for incorporating such evidence into pretrained image-to-3D generative models without retraining or finetuning. To do this, we guide generation using a ray-consistent observation likelihood defined over the model's occupancy representation, combining surface occupancy and free-space evidence. Applied to SAM 3D and its multi-view extension, our approach substantially improves geometric fidelity across different levels of observability, as well as visual quality. Our results demonstrate that pretrained image-to-3D models can effectively integrate partial geometric observations through explicit test-time guidance, complementing their learned generative priors without modifying the underlying model.

## 4. A positive resolution of the gap-entropy conjecture
**Authors:** P. M. Aronow, Nathan Kallus, Patrick Lopatto

**Summary:** We prove the gap-entropy conjecture for fixed-confidence best-arm identification with independent unit-variance Gaussian arms, means in $[0,1]$, and a unique optimal arm. For each suboptimal arm $i$, let $Δ_i=μ_*-μ_i$ be its gap from the optimal mean, and write $H=\sum_{i e *}Δ_i^{-2}$. Let $p_r$ be the fraction of $H$ contributed by arms with $2^{-(r+1)}<Δ_i\le2^{-r}$, and let $\mathrm{Ent}(I)=\sum_{r:p_r>0} p_r\log(1/p_r)$. Among all algorithms that identify the optimal arm with probability at least $1-δ$ on every Gaussian instance, the optimal expected number of samples on a given instance, averaged over all permutations of the arm labels, is within absolute constant factors of $H(\log(1/δ)+\mathrm{Ent}(I))$. Moreover, there is an algorithm, independent of the instance, whose expected number of samples is bounded by a constant multiple of this quantity plus $g^{-2}\log\log(e^e/g)$, where $g=\min_{i e *}Δ_i$ is the gap to the closest competitor.

## 5. Characterizing Language Generation in the Limit: Finite Witnesses and a Separation-Width Hierarch
**Authors:** Xiaoyu Li, Andi Han, Jiaojiao Jiang, Junbin Gao

**Summary:** Language generation in the limit asks for valid unseen elements from every exhaustive positive presentation of an unknown infinite language. We characterize this task for arbitrary families over a countable universe. Generation is possible exactly when each target can be assigned a finite positive witness so that the targets activated by any finite sample have an infinite common intersection. The necessary direction follows from a universal normalization: a search through unconfirmed histories converts any successful generator into one depending only on the observed set. We then ask how large compatible witnesses must be. Positive separation width records the smallest uniform size bound, with two further levels for unbounded finite witnesses and the absence of any compatible finite-witness assignment. Every level occurs. Countable families admit singleton witnesses, explicit families realize every finite width, and a union of two families with infinite common cores requires unbounded finite witnesses. Finally, countable-support and finite-profile obstructions explain why local combinatorial data cannot determine generation in the limit. The characterization and full width hierarchy are checked in Lean, including the simplified normalization and a direct diagonal capture lemma. The accompanying Lean development is maintained at https://github.com/xiaoyulics/language-generation-characterization

## 6. Precision in Rice Variety Classification using Stacking-Based Ensemble Learning
**Authors:** Md. Masudul Islam, Galib Muhammad Shahriar Himel, Md. Golam Moazzam, Mohammad Shorif Uddin

**Summary:** Rice, a staple food for a significant portion of the global population, exhibits remarkable diversity in its varieties, presenting substantial challenges for accurate identification by consumers, traders, and farmers. This complexity often facilitates fraudulent practices, such as the unauthorized mixing of rice types, which undermines quality and trust in the supply chain. Despite its critical importance, existing research falls short of providing robust and efficient methods for precise rice variety classification based on external characteristics like color, size, and texture. To address this gap, our study introduces a comprehensive rice variety identification framework designed to enhance transparency and quality assurance. We developed a stacked ensemble model tailored for rice variety classification and curated a comprehensive dataset comprising 20 rice varieties, each distinguished by unique visual attributes. The proposed approach achieved an unprecedented classification accuracy of 100%. Furthermore, we integrated our model into a mobile application, enabling even novice users to effortlessly identify rice varieties using grain images from a smartphone camera. These findings underscore the transformative potential of advanced machine learning techniques in mitigating fraudulent practices and ensuring stringent rice quality control. Our work holds significant implications for agricultural stakeholders, paving the way for automated crop identification systems and advancing precision agriculture practices.

## 7. Show-Harness: Just a VLM Agent Can Play Robots
**Authors:** Yanzhe Chen, Zechen Bai, Zhijun Cao, Wenzheng Zeng, Kevin Qinghong Lin, Yiqi Lin, Guoqiang Liang, Kevin Yuchen Ma, Qiming Huang, Mike Zheng Shou

**Summary:** Foundation vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit broad intelligence about the world, yet translating this intelligence into robot control remains challenging. We present Show-Harness, an Embodied Harness that enables VLMs to "play" robots through a compact semantic interface linking intent to action. Show-Harness exposes discrete semantic action units that VLMs can naturally reason over, while embodiment-specific interpreters deterministically ground them into local robot actions, keeping the VLM directly responsible for fine-grained physical decisions. Through the same interface, Show-Harness demonstrates the feasibility of (1) directly unlocking closed-source frontier VLMs for zero-shot robot control, and (2) adapting small-scale open-source VLMs for low-cost deployment with just a few GPU-hours of fine-tuning. We further develop GUMI (GUI Manipulation Interface), which extends the same semantic action space to GUI-based demonstration collection, allowing humans and agents to "play" robots across embodiments without specialized teleoperation hardware. Extensive experiments show that Show-Harness-equipped VLM agents generalize robustly across tasks, embodiments, and environments, outperforming representative agentic and VLA paradigms. These results suggest that the right interface can unlock substantial embodied capability from foundation VLMs, without requiring additional model capacity or costly embodiment-specific pretraining.

## 8. BrainTaskonomy: Learning How to Pretrain and What to Transfer in fMRI Foundation Models
**Authors:** Junfeng Xia, Wenhao Ye, Junxiang Zhang, Jiayu Zuo, Mo Wang, Quanying Liu

**Summary:** fMRI foundation models increasingly aggregate heterogeneous data across brain states, cohorts, and acquisition settings, yet pretraining domains are commonly treated as a flat mixture and downstream tasks are adapted independently. We study whether measured learning relations can organize both stages without modifying the backbone. During pretraining, a lightweight Brain-DiT proxy estimates difficulty and directed facilitation across ten fMRI domains, yielding a priority-guided cumulative domain curriculum combined with high-to-low-noise timestep scheduling and joint consolidation. During adaptation, controlled first- and higher-order transfer across fifteen tasks constructs a directed taskonomy, from which budgeted integer programming (BIP) selects directly supervised source tasks and target-specific routes. The joint priority-domain and high-to-low-timestep curriculum reduces v-NMSE, PSD-NMSE, and FC-MSE by 6.5%, 16.3%, and 10.5%, respectively, relative to uniform sampling over both dimensions, and shows strong downstream performance across six in- and out-of-domain tasks. The taskonomy reveals asymmetric, target-dependent transfer, while exploratory sealed-test evaluation shows larger descriptive gains for BIP policies when higher-order route spaces are available than for matched random controls. Together, these findings support organizing fMRI pretraining and adaptation by measured learning relations rather than treating domains and tasks as independent flat sets.

## 9. Optimal Low-Rank Quantum State Tomography with Bounded-Sample Joint Measurements
**Authors:** Ashwin Nayak, Xingyu Zhou

**Summary:** We determine the optimal sample complexity of low-rank quantum state tomography when each measurement may act jointly on at most $t$ samples. For sufficiently small $\varepsilon$, estimating an unknown state on $\mathbb{C}^d$ of rank at most $r$ to trace norm error $\varepsilon$ with constant success probability requires, and is achievable with, $$
  Θ\left(
  \frac{dr}{\varepsilon^2}
  \max\left\{1,\frac r{\sqrt t}\right\}
  \right)$$ samples. The lower bound allows the protocol to choose each joint measurement adaptively using all previous classical outcomes; the matching upper bound is nonadaptive. Thus joint measurements on at most $t$ samples improve the complexity of algorithms making single-sample measurements by at most a factor $\sqrt t$. Further, measuring order $r^2$ samples jointly is necessary and sufficient to attain the unrestricted collective rate.
  For the lower bound, we vary the support of a state with fixed uniform spectrum and bound the Fisher information trace of every joint measurement on $t$ samples. The adaptive Fisher chain rule and the van Trees inequality then give the trace norm lower bound. For the upper bound, we construct and analyze a nonadaptive tomography protocol based on a Gaussian joint measurement. An explicit second moment identity and a conditional Gaussian law outside the state's support give a rank-dependent error analysis, yielding the matching rate.

## 10. DUET-DINO: Simultaneous Cross-View World Modeling for Latent Planning in Robot Manipulation
**Authors:** Nisarga Nilavadi, Ralf Römer, Moritz Reuss, Michael Krawez, Tobias Jülg, Angela P. Schoellig, Rudolf Lioutikov, Wolfram Burgard

**Summary:** Action-conditioned latent world models predict future visual representations, enabling zero-shot goal-conditioned robot planning and control. However, their predictions for fine-grained spatial and rotational actions are unreliable for full 7-DoF end-effector control. To address this gap, we introduce DUET-DINO, a simultaneous cross-view latent world model that jointly learns action-conditioned predictions from static side- and wrist-camera observations through cross-view conditioning. By exploiting complementary global scene and gripper-centric information, DUET-DINO enables latent planning over the full 7-DoF action space. Across spatially diverse reach, orientation-intensive angled-reach, and multi-goal grasp-and-lift tasks, DUET-DINO consistently outperforms single-view and independent dual-view baselines, achieving 92% success on reach, 72.5% on angled-reach, and 60.0% on lift tasks. DUET-DINO is trained from scratch on DROID and RoboArena datasets and generalizes robustly under visual distribution shifts. We further show that while V-JEPA 2 wrist-view predictions underestimate visual dynamics induced by fine-grained actions, DINOv3 predictions better capture action-conditioned scene changes, leading to stronger downstream planning. The code and model checkpoints will be open-sourced. Project page: https://utn-air.github.io/DUET-DINO
